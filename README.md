# for-freecodecamp-celestial-database-exercise
Exercise from freeCodeCamp
I managed to export the universe.sql from CodeRoad by opening a bash window in the lower panel, typing in pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp universe > universe.sql.
However, I could not access this properly.

I went back into the CodeRoad psql editor and opened the universe.sql file.
I then selected all text and cut and paste into a plain text file.
I then saved this file as universe.sql, not .txt, and uploaded it here.

Then I right-clicked to get the copy link, which I cut and paste into Part 2 of the Celestial Bodies Database exercise, even though it was still listing Part 1
as unfinished (it was finished).

Note that before doing this, I refreshed my browser multiple times to refresh the psql to trigger the project as complete.
I find sometimes it says it is complete, but when I go back later, it wants me to press the tick again to finalize completion.

I didn't lose all my hard work, is the main thing! 20 moons! I need a rest now.
